## Inspiration
Proposal suggested by James Larus from (the PEPP-PT https://www.pepp-pt.org/): "Here’s a real problem for which we need some good solutions. As part of our privacy-preserving proximity tracking work (https://github.com/DP-3T), we are going to use Bluetooth to measure distance between peoples’ phones. One big concern is that people put their phones in different places (front pocket, back pocket, shirt pocket, bag, etc.). Can we use the accelerometer and pressure sensor (altitude) to infer where a phone is located on a person’s body? Doesn’t need to be perfect, but the better the inference, the more precise we can make the distance estimation."

## Solution
The envisioned solution will use IMU and light sensor data from the smartphone and a supervised classification technique to decipher in which pocket/body location the smartphone is currently.
