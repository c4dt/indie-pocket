# Installation notes.

classifier.h/.cpp depends on the eigen library. To get it automatically after
you cloned this repository, runs these two commands:
git submodule init
git submodule update

The calibration file generated by the MATLAB function export_calib() should be
added in the classify-app/app/src/main/res/raw directory.
